### **How to test it locally**

Explain how you tested the changes locally and made sure that the PR does what you intend to. \
For example if you working on Frontend Code describe which page you should open and what steps to take to see the changes you made.\
For the backend, which endpoint to hit with which params, best to provide an example like a curl command.
